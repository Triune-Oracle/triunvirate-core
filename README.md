# Triumvirate Core

A bounded multi-agent AI coordination framework emphasizing role separation, auditability, and controlled autonomy.

## Core Innovation
**Digital Suggestion Patterns (DSP)** — a standardized cognitive processing pipeline for multi-agent systems.

## Design Principles
- **Explicit Authority Boundaries**: Roles are clearly defined and non-overlapping.
- **Logged and Auditable Decisions**: Every state transition is recorded for review.
- **Probabilistic Outcomes**: The system acknowledges execution risk and avoids deterministic claims.
- **Narrative Separation**: Strategic vision is decoupled from operational execution logic.

## Status
Reference implementation / research-grade architecture.

## Repository Structure
- `/docs`: Whitepapers, executive summaries, and technical overviews.
- `/governance`: DSP governance specifications and diffusion policies.
- `/prompts`: Role-specific prompt scaffolds (ORACLE, GEMINI, CAPRI, ARIA).
- `/infra`: Infrastructure specifications (Redis, Logging, Hash Anchoring).
- `/audits`: System readiness reports and QA logs.
