## Title
Systems and Methods for Bounded Cognitive Processing in Multi-Agent Artificial Intelligence

## Abstract
Disclosed is a system and method for coordinating multiple artificial intelligence agents using a standardized cognitive processing pipeline that enforces role boundaries, bounded autonomy, and auditable state transitions. The method reduces hallucinated agency, improves reliability, and enables scalable autonomous operation under defined constraints.

## Technical Field
Artificial intelligence; multi-agent systems; autonomous workflows; decision traceability.

## Background
Existing multi-agent AI systems often exhibit role ambiguity, uncontrolled autonomy escalation, and non-auditable decision paths, leading to unpredictable behavior and operational risk.

## Summary of the Invention
The invention introduces a four-stage cognitive pipeline—Perception, Cognition, Implementation, and Integration—applied uniformly across agents. Each agent operates under explicit role constraints, and all state transitions are logged and optionally cryptographically anchored to Ethereum-compatible ledgers.

## Key Claims
1. A method for processing inputs through a bounded cognitive loop comprising perception, cognition, implementation, and integration.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein each stage is constrained by role-specific permissions.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein outputs are logged in a verifiable, append-only memory store.
4. A system implementing the method across multiple agents coordinated via shared state.
5. The system wherein governance rules prevent propagation of unbounded or non-auditable claims.

## Advantages
- Reduced autonomous drift
- Improved explainability
- Safer scaling of agent swarms
- Compatibility with regulatory and audit requirements
