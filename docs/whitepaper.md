# Triumvirate Standup & Digital Suggestion Patterns

## Executive Abstract
The Triumvirate is a multi-agent AI framework designed for bounded autonomy, explicit authority separation, and verifiable memory. Its core contribution is the Digital Suggestion Patterns (DSP) model—a standardized cognitive pipeline that governs how agents perceive information, act, and record outcomes.

## Problem Statement
Autonomous AI systems frequently fail due to:
- Role ambiguity
- Context loss
- Non-auditable decisions

The Triumvirate addresses these issues by enforcing structural discipline rather than expanding agent freedom.

## Architecture Overview
The system separates responsibilities across four roles:
- **ORACLE** — directive authority
- **GEMINI** — strategic decomposition
- **CAPRI** — execution
- **ARIA** — knowledge, QA, and memory

All actions pass through DSP’s cognitive loop and are logged for review.

## Digital Suggestion Patterns (DSP)
DSP is not persuasion technology. It is a process standard that ensures:
- Consistent reasoning pathways
- Reduced hallucinated agency
- Clear accountability
- Easier auditing

## Infrastructure & Integrity
- Event coordination via Redis
- Long-term memory via Git and IPFS
- Optional cryptographic anchoring on Ethereum with Polygon fallback
- Preference for no-KYC, sovereignty-preserving integrations

## Conclusion
The Triumvirate demonstrates that autonomy scales safely only when it is constrained. DSP provides a replicable method for building AI systems that are explainable, auditable, and resilient.
