# Executive Summary: Triumvirate Framework

## Overview
The Triumvirate is a modular AI coordination framework emphasizing clear authority separation, logged and reviewable decisions, and controlled autonomy. It is designed to support experimentation without requiring trust in opaque AI behavior.

## Key Innovation
Digital Suggestion Patterns (DSP) standardizes how AI systems:
- Interpret information
- Make decisions
- Record outcomes

This improves reliability and transparency.

## Risk Posture
- No guaranteed outcomes
- No deterministic claims
- No identity-coupled financial assumptions
- Explicit separation between narrative framing and system operation

## Applicability
Suitable for:
- Multi-agent AI research
- Autonomous workflows
- Audit-sensitive environments
- Long-term system evolution

## Closing
The Triumvirate prioritizes correctness over spectacle. Its value lies in how decisions are constrained, not in what outcomes are promised.
