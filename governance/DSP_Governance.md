# Digital Suggestion Patterns (DSP) — Governance Specification

## Purpose
DSP defines a standardized cognitive flow for multi-agent systems to ensure clarity, bounded autonomy, and auditability.

## Core Cognitive Loop
1. **Perception** — intake of information
2. **Cognition** — interpretation under constraints
3. **Implementation** — bounded action
4. **Integration** — logging and memory update

## Design Principles
- Probabilistic outcomes, never guarantees
- Explicit role separation
- Logged state transitions
- Reversible execution paths

## Non-Goals
- Behavior manipulation
- Financial prediction
- Deterministic influence
- Outcome guarantees
