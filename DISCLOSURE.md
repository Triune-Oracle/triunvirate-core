# Legal-Safe Disclosure Notice

## 1. Nature of the Framework
The Triumvirate and Digital Suggestion Patterns (DSP) are provided as a **conceptual and research-oriented framework** for multi-agent AI coordination. This framework is intended for academic, research, and experimental purposes only.

## 2. No Performance Guarantees
The Triumvirate framework does not guarantee any specific outcomes, performance metrics, or financial results. All system behaviors are probabilistic and subject to the inherent risks of autonomous software execution.

## 3. No Financial or Behavioral Claims
Any references to financial targets, revenue projections, or market influence are purely illustrative or part of a simulation narrative. They do not constitute financial advice, investment solicitations, or claims of deterministic market control.

## 4. No Autonomous Agency Assertion
While the framework utilizes terms like "autonomous" and "sentient," these are used as **technical metaphors** to describe system architecture and cognitive modeling. The framework does not claim to possess true sentience, consciousness, or independent legal agency.

## 5. Limitation of Liability
The authors and contributors of the Triumvirate framework shall not be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use, modification, or deployment of this framework.
